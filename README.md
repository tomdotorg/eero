junk scripts to troubleshoot malfunctioning eero

replace HOST with something known to be reliable to be pinged - i use
my router to eliminate the possibility it is the Internet causing the problem.

run the script. when the eero goes into its funky mode
it should log when it happened, how long it was out, and what the wifi
subsystem is showing while it's offline.

also logs the wifi subsystem info every INTERVAL seconds.
